# PardallMarkdown Phoenix LiveView Demo

Basic demo project for the [PardallMarkdown](https://github.com/alfredbaudisch/pardall_markdown) framework. 

Notice: this demo project is incomplete and lacking sample content while PardallMarkdown (the framework) itself is ready to be used

Expect this demo and a video tutorial do be released by around 18/09.

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
